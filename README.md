# react-native-graphql

React Native + Apollo Graphql for [GraphQL API v4](https://developer.github.com/v4/).

**Expo:** https://exp.host/@jpuri/react-native-graphql

**Running Locally:**
To run the application locally replace `config.example.js` with `config.js` and add your [Github Key](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/keys/) with public access to it.

Follow the following steps:

* npm install
* react-native run-ios

**TODOs:**

* OAuth 2.0 integration for github login
* Adding .env variables for configuration (env variables does not seems to work [issue](https://github.com/babel/minify/issues/687)).
